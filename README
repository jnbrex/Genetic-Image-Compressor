Compiles using g++ on linux and uses the openCV library.

To compile: g++ -std=c++11 `pkg-config --cflags opencv` -o GA main.cpp draw.cpp pkg-config --libs opencv`

To run: ./GA imagename.jpg N K E

imagename.jpg is the input image name, and N, K, and E are the population size, number of children, and search effort values respectively.

Running this program will output the highest fitness value after every 1000 children, but by uncommenting the commented out code
near the bottom of main.cpp, the program can also output the images corresponding to each fitness value.
